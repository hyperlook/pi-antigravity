# Contributing

Thanks for improving `pi-antigravity`.

## Before opening an issue

- Search existing issues first.
- Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues; follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Include the Pi version, package version, operating system, selected model, and sanitized `/antigravity doctor` output when reporting a bug.

## Development setup

```bash
bun install
bun run check
```

This repo uses [Bun](https://bun.sh). `bun run check` runs TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and the repository security checks. Run it before opening a pull request.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository and create a focused branch.
2. Keep changes small and explain their user impact.
3. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
4. Update documentation when commands, authentication, configuration, or models change.
5. Ensure `bun run check` passes.

Do not include credentials, access tokens, refresh tokens, OAuth client secrets, or private account data in commits, issues, pull requests, or logs.

## Releases

Maintainers publish releases by pushing a version tag (`vX.Y.Z`). Contributors must not publish the package or modify release credentials.
